## Summary Statement
I have a background in psychology and data analytics. I have worked as a research analyst, data analyst and research academic in various health, not-for-profit and academic settings. I am proficient in quantitative and qualitative research. I have experience with R, Python, SQL, SPSS, JASP, Excel, Alteryx, Power BI, Tableau, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, and MySQL Workbench. I have very strong communication, interpersonal, presentation and writing skills along with a caring and professional demeanor. 

## Work Experience
### Doctor of Psychology / Couples Counsellor (Nov 2012 - Present)
I have owned and operated a private counselling and wellness practice in the Sutherland Shire of Sydney, Australia. This practice was a clinical psychology practice for many years until my approach transitioned into psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, kinesiology and holistic coaching. 

### Data Analyst, Western Sydney University (Jul 2019 - Nov 2020)
I was responsible for overseeing the development of a large multisite database for Western Sydney University’s Student Engagement service. The role was a blend of research and data analytics. It involved reviewing empirical literature on student engagement, developing models for service evaluation from student engagement literature, collecting data, and developing reporting dashboards using PowerBI and Tableau. It also involved educating staff on topics such as the student engagement literature, the role of research and data analytics in service development, collecting and analysing data across WSU campuses, facilitating in-service training and workshops, and analysing and reporting course metrics to stakeholders.
