The following files are examples of my work across various platforms, including python, R, tableau, powerBI and JASP.
These are "warts and all" examples. You can see what I did well and the areas where I needed support.

The following files are available (as at February 2024)

1) COVID19Dash.pdf - This is a simple dashboard to demonstrate Tableau 
2) CaseStudyExample2024.pdf - This is a pdf file showing the data analysis for a single case research design study of a person receiving a novel intetervention for pain and sleep disorder. The open source platform JASP has been used for this project. It is similar to SPSS.
3) EDA_ASSIGNMENT_LYONS.ipynb - This python file shows coding for an exploratory data analysis
4) IOD Capstone Note Book_Geoff.ipynb - This file shows python coding for a capstone project that included predictive modelling
5) IOD_REgression_Assignment-Copy1.ipynb - This file shows python coding for a basic EDA and regression analysis
6) MA5800 Final Capstone Code.R - This file shows R coding for an EDA
7) SQLQuery2_DataWrangling.sql - A SQL file demonstrating data wrangling
8) SQLQuery2_SelectingData.sql - A SQL file also demonstrating data wrangling
9) University Dashboard_redacted.pdf - This pdf file shows a dashboard that I developed for a university showing student engagement across university services. This dashboard was developed in both PowerBI and Tableau however a redacted file is all that could be shared.
