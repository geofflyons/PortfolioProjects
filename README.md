I have very strong communication, interpersonal, presentation and writing skills along with a caring and professional demeanor. 

## Work Experience
### Doctor of Psychology / Couples Counsellor (Nov 2012 - Present)
I have owned and operated a private counselling and wellness practice in the Sutherland Shire of Sydney, Australia. This practice was a clinical psychology practice for many years until my approach transitioned into psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, kinesiology and holistic coaching. 

### Data Analyst, Western Sydney University (Jul 2019 - Nov 2020)
I was responsible for overseeing the development of a large multisite database for Western Sydney University’s Student Engagement service. The role was a blend of research and data analytics. It involved reviewing empirical literature on student engagement, developing models for service evaluation from student engagement literature, collecting data, and developing reporting dashboards using PowerBI and Tableau. It also involved educating staff on topics such as the student engagement literature, the role of research and data analytics in service development, collecting and analysing data across WSU campuses, facilitating in-service training and workshops, and analysing and reporting course metrics to stakeholders.

### Research Analyst, Wyla Wellness Ltd (Jul 2018 - Jan 2022)
Wyla Wellness Ltd is a not-for-profit charity that provides nature-based residential programs for the treatment of mental health in Australian veterans and first responders. I played a leadership role in the organisation; helping develop it from its inception through to a government recognised not-for-profit charity with DGR status. This includes writing literature reviews, grant proposals, designing and implementing research projects (design, ethics approval, data collection and analysis, report preparation), writing proposals for stakeholders, and contributing to governance. A core component of this role was directing research strategy and implementing research projects.

### Senior Lecturer, Australian College of Applied Psychology (Mar 2016 - Mar 2019)
This was a specialised position comprising multiple roles with the Discipline of Psychological Science’s postgraduate Professional Psychology Program. These duties included: (1) providing academic leadership within the Discipline’s Professional Programs; (2) the development and provision of high quality postgraduate training in professional psychology; (3) the supervision of provisional psychologists; (4) the coordination of adult psychometric assessments and supervision of students in psychometric assessments; (5) the development and management of student research projects; (6) and the maintenance of an active research profile.

### Lecturer, Australian Catholic University (Jul 2014 – March 2016)
This role was with the School of Psychology’s Postgraduate Professional Psychology Program. It was similar to the role of Senior Lecturer outlined above. The main difference being that this role had less leadership duties and a reduction in the number of research students supported. In this role I specialised in teaching clinical health psychology, psychological assessment, and counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy.

### Research Analyst, Illawarra Institute for Mental Health (Jan 2008 – Jul 2013)
In this role I contributed to data collection and the management of a large multisite database for a project working with a major not-for-profit provider of drug and alcohol treatment services. The role involved collecting and analysing data from multiple drug and alcohol treatment centres across Australia, training and supervising junior researchers in this process, analysing data, drafting reports and presentations, and delivering project outcomes to stakeholders. Writing journal articles for publication and managing all aspects of the publication process was also required.
